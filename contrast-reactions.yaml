# 1.  Can we give MRI/gadolinium based contrast to a pregnant patient?

  - [recommendations, ACR, MRI, contrast, pregnant, patient*]

  title: Gadolinium-Based Contrast Agents in Pregnant Patients
  text: |
    To date, there have been no known adverse effects to human fetuses reported when clinically recommended dosages of
    gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) have been given to pregnant women.  Because it is unclear how GBCAs will
    affect the fetus, these agents should be administered with caution to pregnant or potentially pregnant patients.
    GBCAs should only be used if their usage is considered critical and the potential benefits justify the potential
    unknown risk to the fetus.

    If a GBCA is to be used in a pregnant patient, one of the agents believed to be at low
    risk for the development of NSF [12] should be used at the lowest possible dose to achieve diagnostic results.
    In pregnant patients with severely impaired renal function, the same precautions should be observed as in non-pregnant patients.

  title: Breastfeeding - Iodinated Contrast
  text: |
    Because of the very small percentage of iodinated contrast medium that is excreted into the breast milk and
    absorbed by the infant’s gut, we believe that the available data suggest that it is safe for the mother and infant to
    continue breast-feeding after receiving such an agent.

    Ultimately, an informed decision to temporarily stop breast-feeding should be left up to the mother after these
    facts are communicated. If the mother remains concerned about any potential ill effects to the infant, she may
    abstain from breast-feeding from the time of contrast administration for a period of 12 to 24 hours. There is no
    value to stop breast feeding beyond 24 hours. The mother should be told to express and discard breast milk
    from both breasts during that period. In anticipation of this, she may wish to use a breast pump to obtain milk
    before the contrast-enhanced study to feed the infant during the 24-hour period following the examination.

  title: Oral contrast usage in patients with history of anaphylactoid reactions
  text: |
    Because anaphylactoid reactions are not considered to be dose related and can occur
    with less than 1 ml of intravenous (IV) contrast media, it is generally accepted that allergic-like reactions can
    occur even from the small amounts of contrast medium absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Somewhat
    surprisingly, there are only very rare reports of moderate or severe allergic-like reactions to orally or rectally
    administered iodinated contrast media [51].

  title: Creatinine cutoff for Gadolinium contrast
  text: |
    Based on current knowledge, it is estimated that patients with end-stage CKD (CKD5, eGFR <15 ml/min/1.73 m2) and
    severe CKD (CKD4, eGFR 15-29 ml/min/1.73 m2) have a 1% to 7% chance of developing
    NSF after one or more exposures to group 1 GBCAs with the strongest association with NSF [1-6,9].
    However, most patients who developed NSF had end-stage kidney disease and were on dialysis at the time of
    exposure. Moreover, among patients with severe CKD (CKD4) that developed NSF (approximately 3% of all
    reported NSF cases), most had an eGFR closer to 15 ml/min/1.73 m2 than to 30 ml/min/1.73 m2. There has been
    only one published case report of a patient with eGFR values above 30 ml/min/1.73 m2 [10].

  title: Creatinine cutoff for Iodinated contrast
  text: |
    There is no agreed-upon threshold of serum creatinine elevation or eGFR declination beyond which the risk of
    CIN is considered so great that intravascular iodinated contrast medium should never be administered. In fact,
    since each contrast medium administration always implies a risk-benefit analysis for the patient, contrast
    medium administration for all patients should always be taken in the clinical context, considering all risks,
    benefits and alternatives.

    In a 2006 survey of radiologists by Elicker et al [64], the cutoff value for serum creatinine beyond which
    intravascular iodinated contrast medium would not be administered varied widely among radiology practices.
    For patients with no risk factors other than elevated serum creatinine, 35% of respondents used
    1.5 mg/dL, 27% used 1.7 mg/dL, and 31% used 2.0 mg/dL (mean, 1.78 mg/dL). Threshold values were
    slightly lower in patients with diabetes mellitus (mean: 1.68 mg/dL).

  title: IV Contrast Media Usage in Pediatric Patients
  text: |
    There are limited data available on the use of i.v. contrast media for CT studies in the pediatric population.
    The purpose of this study is to determine the practice patterns of i.v. contrast media usage for pediatric CT by
    members of the Society for Pediatric Radiology (SPR).

    RESULTS:
    The response rate of 6% (88/1545) represented practice patterns of 26% (401/1545) of the SPR membership.
    Most respondents thought the following clinical information was mandatory before i.v. contrast media administration:
    allergy to i.v. contrast media (97%), renal insufficiency (97%), current metformin use (72%), significant allergies (61%),
    diabetes (54%), and asthma (52%). Most administered i.v. contrast media through nonimplanted central venous catheters (78%),
    implanted venous ports (78%), and peripherally inserted central catheters (72%).

    The most common maximum i.v. contrast media injection rates were 5.0 mL/s or greater for a 16-gauge angiocatheter,
    4.0 mL/s for an 18-gauge angiocatheter, 3.0 mL/s for a 20-gauge angiocatheter, and 2.0 mL/s for a 22-gauge angiocatheter.
    For soft-tissue extravasation of i.v. contrast media, 95% elevate the affected extremity, 76% use ice, and 45% use heat.

    - Elevate legs at least 60 degrees
    - IV fluids: 0.9% normal saline or Lactated Ringers; 1,000mL rapidly

    Hypotension with tachycardia (pulse > 100bom) if hypotension persists:
    - Epinephrine (IV): IV 1 mL of 1:10,000 dilution (0.1 mg); administer slowly
      into a running IV infusion of fluids; can repeat every few minutes as needed up to 10mL (1 mg) total
    OR
    - Epinephrine (IM): IM 0.3mL of 1:1,000 dilution (0.3mg); can repeat every 5-15 minutes up to 1 mL (1 mg) total
    OR
    - Epinephrine auto-injector (EpiPen® or equivalent): (0.3 mL of 1:1,000 dilution, fixed[0.3mg]); can repeat every
    5-15 minutes up to three times

    Note: in hypotensive patients, the preferred route of epinephrine delivery is IV, as the extremities may not be perfused sufficiently
    to allow for adequate absorption of IM administered drug.

  text: |
    Note: While IV corticosteroids may help prevent a short-term recurrence of an
    allergic-like reaction,they are not useful in the acute treatment of any reaction.
    However,these maybe considered for patients having severe allergic-like
    manifestations prior to transportation to an Emergency Department or inpatient unit.

    Treatment:
    - Hydrocortisone (Solu-Cortef®) (IV) IV 5 mg / kg; administer over 1-2 min
    OR
    - Methylprednisolone (Solu-Medrol®) (IV) IV 1 mg / kg; administer over 1-2 min
