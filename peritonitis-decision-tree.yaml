  title: Diagnosis of Peritonitis
  text : |
    Sure Doc! I can help you diagnose peritonitis based on the ISPD 2016 guidelines.
    Does your patient have at least 2 of the following are present: (1) clinical features consistent with peritonitis,
    i.e. abdominal pain and/or cloudy dialysis effluent; (2) dialysis effluent white cell count > 100/μL or > 0.1 × 109/L
    (after a dwell time of at least 2 hours), with > 50% polymorphonuclear; and (3) positive dialysis effluent culture (1C).

    We recommend that PD patients presenting with cloudy effluent be presumed to have peritonitis and
    treated as such until the diagnosis can be confirmed or excluded (1C).

    Patients with peritonitis usually present with cloudy PD effluent and abdominal pain. Cloudy effluent almost
    always represents infectious peritonitis, although there are other differential diagnoses (Table 4) (206).
    Some patients present with cloudy effluent but no or minimal abdominal pain. On the other hand, peritonitis
    should also be included in the differential diagnosis of the PD patient presenting with abdominal pain, even
    if the effluent is clear. In addition to the presenting symptoms, the patient should be questioned about any
    recent contamination, accidental disconnection, endoscopic or gynecologic procedure, as well as the presence
    of constipation or diarrhea. In addition, the patient should be questioned about past history of peritonitis
    and ESI.

    Else, unlikely to have peritonitis.

  title: Peritonitis Management
  text : |
    When peritonitis is suspected, dialysis effluent should be drained, carefully inspected, and sent for cell count
    with differential, Gram stain, and culture (207). An effluent cell count with white blood cells (WBC) > 100/μL
    (after a dwell time of at least 2 hours), with > 50% PMN, is highly suggestive of peritonitis (208).
    Abdominal X ray is generally not necessary. Peripheral blood culture is usually not necessary but should be
    obtained if the patient is clinically septic. To prevent delay in treatment, antibiotic therapy (see below)
    should be initiated once the appropriate dialysis effluent specimens have been collected, without waiting for
    the results of laboratory testing.

    The WBC count in the effluent depends in part on the length of the dwell.
    For patients on APD with rapid cycle treatment, the clinician should use the percentage of PMN
    rather than the absolute WBC count to diagnose peritonitis, and a proportion above 50% PMN is strong evidence
    of peritonitis, even if the absolute WBC count is less than 100/μL (208). On the other hand,
    APD patients without a daytime exchange who present with abdominal pain during the daytime may have no effluent
    to drain. In this case, 1 L of dialysis solution should be infused, dwelled for 1 to 2 hours, and then drained
    for inspection and laboratory testing.

    We recommend that empirical antibiotic therapy be initiated as soon as possible after appropriate microbiological specimens have been obtained (1C).

    We recommend that empirical antibiotic regimens be center-specific and cover both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms (1C).

    We recommend that gram-positive organisms be covered by vancomycin or a first generation cephalosporin and gram-negative organisms by a third-generation cephalosporin or an aminoglycoside (1B).

  title: Identification of Causative Organism
  text : |
    We recommend that the blood-culture bottle be the preferred technique for bacterial culture of PD effluent (1C).

    We suggest that sampling and culture methods be reviewed and improved if more than 15% of peritonitis episodes are culture-negative (2C).

    Gram stain of the PD effluent should be performed even though the result is often negative (209).
    The yield on the Gram stain is increased if it is performed on centrifuged specimens.
    An appropriate method of culturing PD effluent is the most important step in establishing the causative organism.
    In some specialized centers, one could achieve less than 10% rate of culture negative peritonitis.
    Identification of the organism and subsequent antibiotic sensitivities help to guide the choice of antibiotic,
    and the type of organism often indicates the possible source of infection. Bedside inoculation of 5 – 10 mL
    effluent in 2 (aerobic and anaerobic) blood-culture bottles has a reasonable sensitivity, and the
    culture-negative rate is typically around 10 – 20%. (210,211). The yield of peritoneal fluid culture is
    enhanced by inoculating the fluid directly into rapid blood-culture bottle kits (e.g. BACTEC, Kent, UK;
    Septi-Chek, Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland; BacT/Alert, Biomerieux, Inc., Basingstoke, UK),
    centrifuging PD fluid and culturing the pellet, or the lysis centrifugation technique compared to inoculation
    into standard blood-culture bottles. Specifically, centrifugation of 50 mL PD effluent at 3,000 g for 15 minutes,
    followed by resuspension of the sediment in 3 – 5 mL supernatant and inoculation on solid culture media or
    standard blood-culture media, increases the yield by 5 to 10 times but is more cumbersome (212,213).
    The combination of water lysis, Tween-80 blood agar and Triton-X treatment of the PD effluent is also a
    sensitive culture method (214). The specimens should arrive at the laboratory within 6 hours. If immediate
    delivery to the laboratory is not possible, the inoculated culture bottles should ideally be incubated at 37°C.
    The solid media should be incubated in aerobic, microaerophilic, and anaerobic environments.

    The speed with which bacteriological diagnosis can be established is very important. Concentration methods do
    not only facilitate microbial identification, but also reduce the time needed for a positive culture.
    In over 75% of cases, microbiologic diagnosis can be established in less than 3 days. When the causative
    microorganism has been identified, subsequent cultures for monitoring may be performed by only inoculating the
    effluent in blood-culture bottles.

    When cultures remain negative after 3 – 5 days of incubation, PD effluent should be sent for repeat cell count,
    differential count, fungal, and mycobacterial culture. In addition, subculture on media with aerobic, anaerobic,
    and microaerophilic incubation conditions for a further 3 – 4 days may help to identify slow-growing fastidious
    bacteria and yeasts that are undetectable in some automated culture systems.

  title: Gram Positive
  text : |
    For gram-positive coverage, several studies compared a first-generation cephalosporin with a
    glycopeptide-based regimen (228–231). When analyzed as a whole, glycopeptide-based regimens result in a
    higher complete cure rate, but there is no difference in the rate of primary treatment failure, relapse,
    or catheter removal (203). A systematic review noted that the result was largely influenced by 1 study,
    in which the dosage of cefazolin was substantially lower than current recommendations (228).
    Other studies found no difference in cure rates for vancomycin and cefazolin when an appropriate cephalosporin
    dose was used (228,230,231). Nonetheless, some PD units have a high rate of methicillin-resistant organisms
    and vancomycin may be preferable for empirical gram-positive coverage (232), although it remains controversial
    what threshold prevalence of methicillin resistance would justify the routine empirical use of vancomycin as
    gram-positive coverage.

  title: Gram Negative
  text : |
    For the coverage of gram-negative organisms, previous studies have shown that aminoglycosides
    (e.g. gentamicin or netilmicin) (233), ceftazidime (233), cefepime (234), or a carbapenem (235,236)
    are all effective. Cefepime per se has reasonable activity against gram-positive bacteria and monotherapy
    may be feasible (234). Fluoroquinolones could also be used if supported by the local antimicrobial
    susceptibilities of antibiotic sensitivities (237–241). For patients allergic to cephalosporins,
    aztreonam is also a possible alternative (242–244). In a randomized controlled study, IP netilmicin and
    ceftazidime had similar efficacy to empirical gram-negative coverage (233). Short-term aminoglycoside treatment
    is inexpensive, safe, and provides good gram-negative coverage. There is no evidence that short courses of
    aminoglycosides accelerate the loss of residual renal function (233,245–247). However, repeated or prolonged
    aminoglycoside treatment (more than 3 weeks) was associated with a high incidence of vestibular toxicity or
    oto-toxicity and should be avoided (248,249).

    We recommend that empirical antibiotic therapy be initiated as soon as possible after appropriate microbiological specimens have been obtained (1C).

    We recommend that empirical antibiotic regimens be center-specific and cover both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms (1C).

    We recommend that gram-positive organisms be covered by vancomycin or a first generation cephalosporin and gram-negative organisms by a third-generation cephalosporin or an aminoglycoside (1B).

    Antibiotic treatment should aim for rapid resolution of inflammation and preservation of the peritoneal membrane
    function. No antibiotic regimen has been proved to be superior to others as empirical treatment (203), although
    the combination of a glycopeptide (vancomycin or teicoplanin) plus ceftazidime was considered to be superior to
    other regimens in a proportional meta-analysis (227).

    In addition to the above combinations, a variety of regimens have been shown by prospective trials to have acceptable
    results (250). For example, imipenem/cilastatin monotherapy was as effective as cefazolin plus ceftazidime (236),
    and cefepime was as effective as vancomycin plus netilmicin (234). In another study, oral ofloxacin alone was
    not inferior to cephalothin plus tobramycin (241), but the effectiveness of ciprofloxacin monotherapy has
    declined markedly in the past decade (251).

    It is important to note that antibiotic resistance may develop with extensive empiric use of broad-spectrum
    cephalosporins or fluoroquinolones. The prevalence of resistant pathogens in each program should be regularly
    monitored and the choice of empirical antibiotic may need to be changed accordingly.

  title: Dosage of Antibiotics
  text : |
    We recommend that IP antibiotics be the preferred route of administration unless the patient has features of
    systemic sepsis (1B).

    We suggest that IP aminoglycoside be administered as daily intermittent dosing (2B).

    We recommend that prolonged courses of IP aminoglycoside be avoided (1C).

    We suggest that IP vancomycin be administered intermittently and the serum vancomycin level be kept above
    15 μg/mL (2C).

    We suggest that IP cephalosporin be administered either continuously (in each exchange) or on a daily
    intermittent basis (2C).

    The recommended dosage of antibiotics for the treatment of PD-related peritonitis is summarized in Tables 5
    and 6 (236–239,252–303). However, the recommended dosages of many antibiotics are based on published clinical
    experience rather than formal pharmacokinetic studies. It was recommended previously that for patients with
    substantial residual renal function, the dose of antibiotics that have renal excretion needs to be adjusted
    (12,13). However, recent studies suggest that such adjustments are not necessary (284,304).

  text : |
    The stability and compatibility of various antibiotics for IP administration was reviewed previously (326).
    In essence, vancomycin, aminoglycosides, and cephalosporins can be mixed in the same dialysis solution bag
    without loss of bioactivity. Aminoglycosides and cephalosporins can be added to the same bag, although
    aminoglycoside should not be added to the same bag with penicillins because of chemical incompatibility (326).
    For any antibiotics that are to be admixed, separate syringes must be used for adding the antibiotics.
    Although vancomycin and ceftazidime are compatible when added to dialysis solutions (1 L total volume or greater),
    they are incompatible if combined in the same syringe or added to an empty dialysis solution bag for reinfusion
    into the patient.

    Antibiotics are stable for variable times after being added to the PD solution (327).
    Vancomycin is stable for 28 days in dialysis solutions stored at room temperature, although higher ambient
    temperatures will reduce the duration of stability. Gentamicin is stable for 14 days both at room temperature
    and under refrigeration, but the duration of stability is reduced by admixture with heparin. Cefazolin is
    stable for 8 days at room temperature or for 14 days if refrigerated; addition of heparin has no adverse
    influence. Ceftazidime is stable for 4 days at room temperature or 7 days if refrigerated. Cefepime is stable
    for 14 days if the solution is refrigerated (328).

    Data on the stability of various new antibiotics and PD solutions are limited and often fragmented (329–332).
    Clinicians should remain alert for new studies in this area. In general, icodextrin-based PD solutions are
    compatible with vancomycin, cefazolin, ceftazidime, and gentamicin (329,333,334). When premixed in icodextrin
    solution, these antibiotics are least stable at 37°C and most stable at 4°C, permitting storage for 14 days
    when refrigerated and pre-warming to body temperature prior to administration (334).

  title: Special Considerations for APD
  text : |
    There is a substantial knowledge gap regarding the antibiotic dosing requirements for the treatment of
    peritonitis in APD patients. In general, the intermittent IP dosing listed in Table 4 could be given in the day
    dwell of APD patients. However, extrapolation of data from CAPD to APD may result in significant under-dosing
    in APD patients because rapid exchanges in APD may lead to inadequate time to achieve therapeutic levels when
    antibiotics are given IP intermittently, and APD results in a higher peritoneal clearance of antibiotics than
    CAPD. This problem is particularly obvious amongst high peritoneal transporters. Alternatively, APD patients
    who develop peritonitis may switch temporarily to CAPD. However, it is not always practical to switch because
    patients may not be familiar with the exchange technique, and the supplies for CAPD may not be immediately
    available. A recent report also found that this practice is associated with an increased risk of technique
    failure and fluid overload (335). Resetting the cycler to permit a longer exchange time in such cases is a
    logical alternative, but the efficacy of this approach has not been well studied.

    For patients who remain on rapid-cycle APD, there are few data concerning efficacy of first-generation
    cephalosporins given intermittently. For APD patients treated with cephalosporins added to the daytime exchange
    only, the nighttime IP levels are below the MIC of most organisms. Adding first-generation cephalosporin to
    each exchange would appear to be the safest approach. Although the IP vancomycin level may be low in APD
    patients due to slow diffusion from blood to dialysis solution, a randomized controlled trial in children
    showed that intermittent dosing of vancomycin was as effective as continuous dosing in children receiving APD
    (311). Vancomycin can probably be given intermittently for APD patients. Oral ciprofloxacin can also achieve
    adequate levels within the peritoneum in APD patients (323). In a retrospective, single-center observational
    cohort study of 508 episodes of PD-associated peritonitis in 208 patients, no differences in relapse rates,
    mortality, or the combined end-point of mortality and catheter removal were observed between APD and CAPD
    patients continuing their own PD modality during continuous IP antibiotic treatment in each PD exchange,
    although elevated dialysis effluent leukocyte counts and antibiotic treatment durations were longer in the
    former (90).

  title: Adjunctive Treatments
  text : |
    Some patients with PD-related peritonitis could be managed on an outpatient basis.
    The decision to hospitalize a patient depends on many factors, including hemodynamic status of the patient,
    severity of signs and symptoms, and, for APD patients, the type of treatment schedule chosen, as well as the
    ability to provide IP antibiotics as an outpatient and the reliability of the patient. The rationale for
    anti-fungal prophylaxis has been discussed in a previous section (see Secondary Prevention, above).

    Patients with cloudy effluent may benefit from the addition of heparin 500 units/L IP to prevent occlusion of
    the catheter by fibrin. Depending on the severity of symptoms, some patients would require analgesics for pain
    control. At the initial presentation and before IP antibiotics are initiated, 1 or 2 rapid PD exchanges are
    often performed for pain relief, although there are no data supporting this approach. A randomized controlled
    trial showed that more extensive rapid-cycle peritoneal lavage during the first 24 hours of peritonitis did
    not affect the rate of complete cure or relapse as compared to the usual practice of 2 rapid exchange cycles
    (336).

    Intraperitoneal urokinase has been advocated for the treatment of biofilm, which may be the cause of refractory
    or relapsing peritonitis. A retrospective study found that IP urokinase and oral rifampicin, in addition to
    conventional antibiotics, resulted in catheter salvage in 64% of cases with persisting asymptomatic infection
    following coagulase-negative staphylococcus peritonitis (337). Randomized controlled trials, however, failed
    to show any benefit of IP urokinase for the treatment of refractory peritonitis (338–340). The rates of
    complete cure, catheter removal, or relapsing episode, as well as overall mortality were not affected by
    adjunctive treatment with IP urokinase. In contrast, 1 randomized controlled study showed that simultaneous
    catheter removal and replacement was superior to IP urokinase in reducing relapsing peritonitis episodes (341).

    Peritoneal permeability to water, glucose, and proteins typically increases during peritonitis. Reduction in
    ultrafiltration is commonly observed, and fluid overload is a frequent complication. Temporary use of
    hypertonic exchanges and short dwell times may be needed to maintain adequate fluid removal. Temporary use of
    icodextrin solution may prevent fluid overload in PD patients with acute peritonitis (342). Because of rapid
    glucose absorption, glycemic control may worsen in diabetic patients. Blood glucose monitoring with appropriate
    adjustments of insulin dosage may be needed. Protein loss during peritonitis is also increased. Screening for
    malnutrition should be undertaken in patients with prolonged peritoneal inflammation.

    We recommend that antibiotic therapy be adjusted to narrow-spectrum agents, as appropriate, once culture results and sensitivities are known. (1C).

    The management algorithms for gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli identified in dialysis effluent are
    summarized in Figures 2 and 3, respectively. Within 48 hours of initiating therapy, most patients with
    PD-related peritonitis will show considerable clinical improvement. The effluent should be visually inspected
    regularly to determine whether clearing is occurring. If there is no improvement after 48 hours, cell counts
    and repeat cultures should be performed. In addition, monitoring of WBC count in PD effluent may predict
    treatment response. A retrospective study showed that dialysis effluent WBC count ≥ 1,090/mm3 on day 3 was an
    independent prognostic marker for treatment failure (343).

  text : |
    We recommend that the PD catheter be removed promptly in refractory peritonitis episodes, defined as failure of the PD effluent to clear up after 5 days of appropriate antibiotics (1C).

    After initiation of antibiotic treatment, there is usually clinical improvement in 72 hours.
    Refractory peritonitis is defined as failure of the PD effluent to clear up after 5 days of appropriate
    antibiotics (Table 7). Catheter removal is indicated in case of refractory peritonitis, or earlier if the
    patient's clinical condition is deteriorating, in order to preserve the peritoneum for future PD as well as
    preventing morbidity and mortality. Prolonged attempts to treat refractory peritonitis by antibiotics without
    catheter removal are associated with extended hospital stay, peritoneal membrane damage, increased risk of

  title: Relapsing, Recurrent, and Repeat Peritonitis
  text : |
    We recommend that timely catheter removal be considered for relapsing, recurrent, or repeat peritonitis episodes (1C).

    The definitions of relapsing, recurrent, and repeat peritonitis are summarized in Table 7.
    Retrospective studies showed that relapsing, recurrent, and repeat peritonitis episodes are caused by
    different species of bacteria and probably represent distinct clinical entities (166,345–347).
    When compared to non-relapsing episodes, relapsing ones are associated with a lower rate of cure,
    more ultrafiltration problems, and higher rate of technique failure (166,348). Recurrent peritonitis episodes
    had a worse prognosis than relapsing ones (166,345). A recent study suggested that bacterial DNA fragment
    levels in PD effluent are significantly higher 5 days before and on the date of completion of antibiotics
    amongst patients who subsequently develop relapsing or recurrent peritonitis (349). Another study suggests
    that effluent white cell count and leukocyte strip test at the time of stopping antibiotics may also predict
    relapse (350). However, further studies are needed to validate these results and confirm their clinical utility.

  title: Coagulase-Negative Staphylococcus
  text : |
    We suggest that coagulase-negative staphylococci generally be treated with IP cephalosporins or vancomycin, according to antimicrobial susceptibility, for a period of 2 weeks. (2C).

    Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus peritonitis episodes, especially those caused by S. epidermidis, are mostly
    due to touch contamination. Many patients with S. epidermidis peritonitis have mild clinical symptoms and
    respond well to treatment as outpatients (351–353). In some centers, the prevalence of methicillin resistance
    is now very high (354,355), and vancomycin may have to be considered as empirical therapy. Even for
    methicillin-sensitive strains, it is important to avoid inadequate IP antibiotic levels, which may lead to
    relapsing peritonitis. For this reason, continuous dosing of IP first-generation cephalosporins is preferable
    to intermittent dosing. Effective antibiotic treatment for 2 weeks is generally sufficient (351–354).
    The patient's exchange technique should be reviewed to prevent another episode.

    Relapsing coagulase-negative Staphylococcus peritonitis suggests colonization of the PD catheter with biofilm,
    and catheter removal should be considered. When the PD effluent becomes clear with antibiotic therapy, many of
    these patients could have simultaneous re-insertion of a new catheter as a single procedure under antibiotic
    coverage, and temporary hemodialysis could be avoided (204). In addition to conventional antibiotics, a
    retrospective study found that IP urokinase and oral rifampicin resulted in catheter salvage in 64% of cases
    with persisting asymptomatic infection following coagulase-negative Staphylococcus peritonitis (337), but the
    benefit of this approach needs to be confirmed by further studies.

  title: Enterococcus Species
  text : |
    We suggest that enterococcal peritonitis be treated for 3 weeks with IP vancomycin (2C).

    We suggest adding IP aminoglycoside for severe enterococcal peritonitis (2D).

    For peritonitis due to vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), we suggest treatment for 3 weeks with
    IP ampicillin if the organism is susceptible or with alternative antibiotics
    (linezolid, quinupristin/dalfopristin, daptomycin or teicoplanin, based on antimicrobial susceptibilities)
    if the organism is ampicillin-resistant (2D).

    Enterococci are normal flora of the gastrointestinal tract (356,357). Intra-abdominal source must be considered.
    Other pathogenic organisms are isolated in about half of the cases of enterococcal peritonitis, and the
    coexistence of other organisms was associated with high rates of catheter removal, permanent hemodialysis
    transfer, and death (356,357).

    Enterococcal species are always resistant to cephalosporins. Identification of the exact species is important
    because resistance to penicillins and carbapenems is far more frequently observed in E. faecium than in
    E. faecalis (358). Although there may be clinical response to empirical therapy with first-generation
    cephalosporins (359), peritonitis episodes should be treated with IP vancomycin if the organism is susceptible.
    For patients with severe signs or symptoms, an aminoglycoside may be added for synergy. However,
    aminoglycosides should not be added to the same bag with penicillins because of chemical incompatibility
    (see Antibiotic Delivery and Stability). Although ampicillin has little in vitro activity when added to common
    PD solutions (331), clinical experience suggests clinical efficiency (356). For vancomycin-resistant
    enterococcus (VRE) causing peritonitis, if the bacterial isolate is ampicillin-susceptible, ampicillin remains
    the drug of choice. Otherwise, linezolid, quinupristin/dalfopristin, or daptomycin are valid options
    (278,281,292,360–363). Given the clinical efficacy and profile of adverse effects, daptomycin is probably the
    first-line antibiotic of choice for peritonitis episodes caused by VRE (278,363–365). Bone marrow suppression
    usually occurs after 10 to 14 days of linezolid therapy, and prolonged therapy may also result in neurotoxicity.
    One previous study showed that removal of the PD catheter within 1 week of the onset of refractory enterococcal
    peritonitis was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of permanent hemodialysis transfer (356).

    Streptococci frequently originate from the mouth (175), although S. bovis typically comes from the colon (366).
    Peritonitis episodes caused by streptococci usually respond well to antibiotic treatment (175,367), but
    viridans streptococcal peritonitis are more likely to be refractory (368). Cefazolin and vancomycin are often
    effective.

    We suggest that Staphylococcus aureus peritonitis be treated with effective antibiotics for 3 weeks (2C).

    Peritonitis episodes caused by Staphylococcus aureus are often secondary to exit-site or tunnel infection,
    although touch contamination is also common. If the bacterial isolate is methicillin-sensitive,
    a first-generation cephalosporin is the drug of choice. Two retrospective studies found that the initial
    empiric antibiotic choice between vancomycin and cefazolin had similar clinical outcomes (369,370). If the
    isolate is methicillin-resistant, IP vancomycin is the drug of choice, but teicoplanin and daptomycin can be
    used as alternatives (371). One study showed that the use of adjuvant rifampicin for 5 to 7 days may reduce
    the risk for relapsing or repeat S. aureus peritonitis (369). However, rifampicin is a potent liver enzyme
    inducer and interaction with other concomitant medications may be problematic.

    Observational data suggest that treatment with effective antibiotics for 3 weeks is needed (369,370,372).
    Prolonged vancomycin therapy may predispose to the emergence of vancomycin-resistant S. aureus and should be
    avoided whenever possible. For patients with concomitant S. aureus exit-site or catheter tunnel infection,
    catheter removal should be considered.

    We suggest that corynebacterial peritonitis be treated with effective antibiotics for 3 weeks (2C).

    Corynebacterium species belong to the natural flora of the skin. Infections due to Corynebacterium
    have been increasingly recognized over the past decades, largely due to improved recognition and
    microbiological techniques. In a retrospective study, Corynebacterium peritonitis often resulted in relapse
    or repeat episodes, catheter removal, permanent hemodialysis transfer, and death (373). Another retrospective
    study found that relapsing Corynebacterium peritonitis was common after a 2-week course of antibiotic treatment,
    but relapsing episodes can usually be cured with a 3-week course of IP vancomycin (374). For refractory
    Corynebacterium peritonitis, observational data suggest that catheter removal within 1 week after the onset of
    peritonitis significantly reduces the risk of permanent hemodialysis transfer (373). For patients with
    concomitant exit-site or catheter tunnel infection caused by Corynebacterium, early catheter removal should be
    considered.

    We suggest that Pseudomonas peritonitis be treated with 2 antibiotics with different mechanisms of action
    and to which the organism is sensitive (e.g. IP gentamicin or oral ciprofloxacin with IP ceftazidime or cefepime) for 3 weeks (2C).

    We suggest that Pseudomonas peritonitis with concomitant exit-site and tunnel infection be treated with
    catheter removal (2D).

    Pseudomonas peritonitis is generally severe and often associated with infection of the catheter. Pseudomonas
    aeruginosa is the most common species. Retrospective studies have shown that Pseudomonas peritonitis is
    associated with greater frequencies of hospitalization, high rates of catheter removal and permanent
    hemodialysis transfer (375–377). The use of 2 anti-pseudomonal antibiotics is associated with better outcomes
    (377). Carbapenems, such as imipenem, meropenem, and doripenem are valid alternatives, especially if the
    bacterial isolate is resistant to cephalosporin and anti-pseudomonal penicillins. If fluoroquinolone is used
    as part of the regimen, ciprofloxacin should be used, while moxifloxacin has very little anti-pseudomonal
    activity. If concomitant catheter infection is present, catheter removal is often needed.

  title: Other Gram-Negative Bacteria
  text : |
    We suggest that non-Pseudomonas gram-negative peritonitis be treated with effective antibiotics for at least
    3 weeks (2C).

    If single gram-negative organisms are isolated, the antibiotic should be chosen according to sensitivity,
    safety, and convenience. It is important to note that bacteria in biofilm are considerably less sensitive than
    that indicated by laboratory testing (378), which may account for the high percentage of treatment failures,
    even though the organism appears to be sensitive to the antibiotic in vitro (379,380). Retrospective studies
    have shown that gram-negative peritonitis had higher risks of catheter loss and death than gram-positive
    episodes (379–384). In one study, recent antibiotic therapy was the major risk factor of antibiotic resistance,
    while ESI, and possibly recent antibiotic therapy, were associated with poor therapeutic response (382).
    The SPICE organisms (Serratia, Pseudomonas, indole-positive organisms such as Proteus and Providentia,
    Citrobacter, and Enterobacter) have amp-C beta-lactamases, which inactivate cephalosporins, and have a high
    risk of relapse. Although single antibiotic therapy is often effective, 1 retrospective study suggested that
    treatment with 2 antibiotics may reduce the risk of relapse and recurrence (382).

    In recent years, there has been widespread emergence of 2 antibiotic resistance
    mechanisms, extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) (385,386) and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae
    (CRE) (385,387); the latter are also called Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing bacteria when
    the carbapenem resistance is mediated by beta-lactamases. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases are resistant to
    all cephalosporins but usually susceptible to carbapenems. Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae/KPC-producing
    bacteria are usually resistant to all classes of beta-lactams, usually resistant to fluoroquinolones, variably
    susceptible to aminoglycosides, but usually susceptible to polymyxin and colistin.

    The isolation of a Stenotrophomonas species, while infrequent, requires special attention, as it is sensitive
    to only a few antimicrobial agents (388,389). Recent treatment with carbapenems, fluoroquinolones, or third- or
    fourth-generation cephalosporins usually precedes Stenotrophomonas infections. Based on limited observational
    data, therapy with 2 antibiotics for 3 to 4 weeks is recommended (388,389). If the isolate is sensitive to
    trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, this agent should be included in the regimen. Tigecycline, polymyxin B, and
    colistin are other possible alternatives.

  title: Polymicrobial Peritonitis
  text : |
    If multiple enteric organisms (multiple gram-negative or mixed gram-negative/gram-positive organisms) are
    grown from PD effluent, we suggest that surgical evaluation be obtained immediately when there is no prompt
    clinical response (1C) and that the patient be treated with metronidazole in conjunction with IP vancomycin
    and either IP aminoglycoside or IP ceftazidime for a minimum period of 3 weeks (2C).

    If multiple gram-positive organisms are grown from PD effluent, we suggest that patients be treated with
    effective antibiotics for 3 weeks (2C).

    When multiple enteric organisms are grown from the PD effluent, there is a possibility of intra-abdominal
    pathology. Presentation with hypotension, sepsis, lactic acidosis, or elevated dialysis effluent amylase
    level should also raise the possibility of abdominal catastrophe (390,391). When a surgical cause of peritonitis
    is suspected, the antibiotics of choice are metronidazole plus vancomycin, in combination with ceftazidime or an
    aminoglycoside. Monotherapy with a carbapenem or piperacillin/tazobactam may also be considered. Assessment by
    a surgeon is needed. Computed tomographic (CT) scan may help to identify the pathology, but a normal CT scan
    does not eliminate that possibility. If laparotomy is needed, the PD catheter is usually removed and antibiotics
    are continued via IV route.

    In contrast, polymicrobial peritonitis due to multiple gram-positive organisms often has a favorable prognosis
    (392,393). Their clinical behavior is similar to peritonitis episodes caused by single gram-positive organisms
    and the etiology may well be touch contamination. Antibiotic therapy is often effective without catheter
    removal (392).

  title: Culture-Negative Peritonitis
  text : |
    We suggest that negative effluent cultures on day 3 warrant a repeat dialysis effluent WBC count with
    differential (2D).

    If the culture-negative peritonitis is resolving at day 3, we suggest discontinuing aminoglycoside therapy
    and continuing treatment with gram-positive coverage (e.g. first-generation cephalosporin or vancomycin)
    for 2 weeks (2C).

    If the culture-negative peritonitis is not resolving at day 3, we suggest special culture techniques be
    considered for isolation of unusual organisms (2C).

    Recent antibiotic usage and technical problems of culturing the specimen are the major reasons for
    negative effluent cultures (394–396). If PD effluent yields no growth after 3 days, a repeat WBC count
    with differential should be obtained. If the repeat cell count indicates that the infection has not resolved,
    special culture techniques may be considered for the isolation of unusual organisms (e.g. mycobacteria,
    nocardia, legionella, filamentous fungus, and other fastidious bacteria). This would require close liaison with
    the microbiology laboratory.

    Many culture-negative peritonitis episodes are probably caused by gram-positive organisms. If the patient
    improves clinically, initial therapy should be continued (394–396). Duration of therapy should be 2 weeks
    if the effluent clears promptly. In contrast, if there is suboptimal response after 5 days of empirical
    antibiotics, catheter removal should be strongly considered.

  title:  Fungal Peritonitis
  text : |
    We recommend immediate catheter removal when fungi are identified in PD effluent (1C).

    We suggest that treatment with an appropriate anti-fungal agent be continued for at least 2 weeks after
    catheter removal (2C).

    Fungal peritonitis is a serious complication with high rates of hospitalization, catheter removal, transfer
    to hemodialysis, and death (397–400). Initial therapy is traditionally a combination of amphotericin B and
    flucytosine. However, IP amphotericin causes chemical peritonitis and pain, while IV administration has poor
    peritoneal bioavailability. In addition, flucytosine is not widely available. If flucytosine is used, regular
    monitoring of serum concentration is necessary to avoid bone marrow toxicity. Peak serum flucytosine levels,
    measured 1 – 2 hours after an oral dose, should be 25 – 50 mcg/mL (401,402).

    Other agents of choice include fluconazole, an echinocandin (e.g. caspofungin, micafungin, or anidulafungin),
    posaconazole, and voriconazole. Although fluconazole is commonly used, the prevalence of azole resistance is
    increasing (403). Fluconazole only has activity against Candida species and Cryptococcus. Echinocandins have
    been advocated for the treatment of fungal peritonitis caused by Aspergillus species and non-albicans Candida
    species, or in patients intolerant to other antifungal therapies (297,298,398). Caspofungin has been used
    successfully as monotherapy or in combination with amphotericin (297,298). Posaconazole and voriconazole have
    been successfully used for the treatment of peritonitis caused by filamentous fungi (287,300,301).

    Irrespective of the choice of anti-fungal agent, observational studies suggest that prompt catheter removal
    probably improves outcome and reduces mortality (300,301,397,398,400,404). Anti-fungal agents should be
    continued after catheter removal for at least 2 weeks. A recent study suggested that around one-third of
    patients could return to PD (399).

  title:  Tuberculous Peritonitis
  text : |
    Although classical symptoms of fever, abdominal pain, and cloudy effluent may occur with tuberculous
    peritonitis, the diagnosis should be considered in any patient with refractory or relapsing peritonitis
    with negative bacterial cultures. Similar to bacterial peritonitis, most cases of tuberculous peritonitis
    have PMN in the dialysis effluent at initial presentation, but lymphocytosis in the dialysis effluent usually
    becomes obvious later. Ziehl-Neelsen stain examination of the PD effluent is often unrevealing, and
    conventional culture technique (e.g. Löwenstein-Jensen agar) is slow and not sufficiently sensitive.
    The time to develop a positive culture is considerably decreased in fluid medium (e.g. Septi-Chek, BACTEC;
    Becton Dickinson, NJ, USA). Overall diagnostic yield could be improved by centrifuging a large volume of
    effluent (50 to 100 mL), followed by culturing the sediment in both solid and fluid media. Alternatively,
    mycobacterial DNA PCR can be performed on dialysis effluent, although false-positives are not uncommon (405).
    Laparoscopy with biopsy of the peritoneum or omentum has also been advocated for rapid diagnosis if the index
    of suspicion is high (406).

    The treatment protocol should be based on general protocols for treatment of tuberculosis but is often
    started with 4 drugs, rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ofloxacin. A previous study showed that
    rifampicin levels in PD effluent are often low (407). Intraperitoneal rifampicin treatment has been advocated
    but is not available in many countries. In general, pyrazinamide and ofloxacin could be stopped after 2 months,
    while rifampicin and isoniazid should be continued for a total of 12 to 18 months (407–413). Pyridoxine
    (50 to 100 mg/day) should be given to avoid isoniazid-induced neurotoxicity. On the other hand, long-term
    use of pyridoxine at a higher dose (e.g. 200 mg daily) is in itself associated with neuropathy and should
    be avoided. Streptomycin, even in reduced doses, may cause ototoxicity after prolonged use and should be
    avoided. Ethambutol is associated with a high risk of optic neuritis in dialysis patients and must be used
    with appropriate dosage reduction. Previous reports suggest a dose of 15 mg/kg every 48 hours or thrice weekly
    for up to 2 months (414). The optimal treatment for drug-resistant tuberculous peritonitis remains unknown.

    Many patients respond to anti-tuberculous therapy without catheter removal (407–413,415). However, it is
    important to differentiate patients with miliary tuberculosis, whose peritonitis is part of the disseminated
    disease, from those with isolated tuberculous peritonitis without extraperitoneal infection, because the
    duration of anti-tuberculous therapy is different.

  text : |
    Data on peritonitis caused by non-tuberculous mycobacteria are limited but may be increasing (21,416–422).
    It is not uncommon for non-tuberculous mycobacteria to be misidentified as gram-positive diphtheroids.
    Over half of the isolates are rapidly growing species, such as M. fortuitum and M. chelonae (420), and
    often become positive on routine bacteriologic cultures in 3 to 5 days. It has been postulated that extensive
    use of topical gentamicin ointment for exit-site infection may predispose patients to non-tuberculous
    mycobacterial infection of the exit site (144). The treatment regimen for non-tuberculous mycobacterial
    peritonitis is not well established and requires individualized protocols based on susceptibility testing.
    Catheter removal is usually necessary, and experience with non-removal is limited (420–422). The type and
    duration of antibiotic therapy are variable, and the optimal treatment regimen is poorly defined and depends
    on species and drug susceptibilities (416–422).

  title: Catheter Removal and Re-Insertion
  text : |
    We recommend that PD catheters be removed for refractory, relapsing, or fungal peritonitis unless there are
    clinical contraindications (1C).

    We suggest that it is appropriate to consider return to PD for many patients who have had their catheter
    removed for refractory, relapsing, or fungal peritonitis (2C).

    We suggest that if re-insertion of a new catheter is attempted after a PD catheter is removed for refractory,
    relapsing, or fungal peritonitis, it be performed at least 2 weeks after catheter removal and complete
    resolution of peritoneal symptoms (2D).

    Indications for catheter removal are summarized in Table 8. For refractory peritonitis and fungal peritonitis,
    simultaneous re-insertion of a new PD catheter is not recommended, and patients should be put on temporary
    hemodialysis. Observational studies suggest that effective antibiotics should be continued for at least 2 weeks
    after catheter removal for refractory peritonitis (423,424).

    After severe episodes of peritonitis, around 50% of patients could potentially return to PD (423–425).
    An ANZDATA Registry study demonstrated that return to PD after catheter removal and temporary hemodialysis
    for peritonitis was not associated with inferior patient-level clinical outcomes when compared with other
    patients who either never required hemodialysis transfer for peritonitis or who had permanent hemodialysis
    transfer for peritonitis (426). Furthermore, subsequent peritonitis-free, technique and patient survival
    following return to PD were not associated with organism type or duration of time from hemodialysis transfer
    to PD restart (426). There are few data on the optimal duration between catheter removal for peritonitis and
    re-insertion of a new catheter. Observational studies suggest a minimum period of 2 to 3 weeks (423–425),
    although some would recommend later re-insertion in cases of fungal peritonitis (397,398). Re-insertion of a
    new catheter should be done by laparoscopic or mini-laparotomy approach so that adhesion can be directly
    visualized. Ultrafiltration problems are common after return to PD (423,424). A small proportion of patients
    with PD-related peritonitis develop recurrent intra-abdominal collection that requires percutaneous drainage
    after catheter removal (427). The chance of a successful return to PD is very low in this group of patients,
    and direct conversion to long-term hemodialysis should be considered (427).
